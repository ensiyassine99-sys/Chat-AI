# Project Installation & Startup Guide

This guide explains how to install and run the project automatically or manually.

## Automatic Installation & Startup

Return to the project root, give the script execution permission, and run it:

```bash
cd ..
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

This will automatically install all dependencies and start both the backend and the frontend.

## Manual Installation & Startup

If you prefer to run each part manually:

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
